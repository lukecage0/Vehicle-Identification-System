Vehicle Identification System

Existing system
In the present Vehicle Identification System if a customer wants to know the details of any vehicle then he/she need to go the concerned office and ask for details, while they get only limited information about definite vehicles. For insurance on any vehicle, a person needs to fill the form manually and should bring all the details regarding the vehicle. An insurance company will maintain the information manually and tracking of a vehicle with such system is a tedious process. For police to find the information of the vehicleâ€™s original owner they need to check various documents of vehicles.

Proposed system
The Vehicle Identification System will be helpful for various people and organization such as a police can identify the vehicle and the owner in no time which will reduce theft of vehicles, an insurance company can track the vehicle while the vehicle workshop will provide better services and a customer can get information of the vehicle in no time, so this Vehicle Identification System will be beneficial for most of them. While it will also help for those who want to buy a second-hand vehicle by contacting the owner through the system.
